## Abstract
Long RP Tachycardia. Introduction: The purpose of this study is to describe a simple and reliable diagnostic maneuver that allows for the rapid differentiation of atypical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) from other causes of long KP tachycardia. Long RP tachycardias may he caused by atypical AVNRT, orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT) involving a slowly conducting retrograde accessory pathway, or atrial tachycardia. The differentiation of atypical AVNRT from ORT or atrial tachycardia may be difficult, especially when the differential diagnosis includes a posteroseptal accessory pathway or an atrial tachycardia arising in the posteroseptal right atrium. Methods and Results: Twelve patients with atypical AVNRT, 21 with ORT, and 12 with an atrial tachycardia diagnosed using conventional criteria were enrolled In this study. The atrial-His (AH) interval was measured at the His-bundle position during the tachycardia and during atrial pacing from the high right atrium at the tachycardia cycle length in the setting of sinus rhythm. In patients with atypical AVNRT, the mean AH interval was 69 msec ± 50 msec (± SD) longer during high right atrial pacing than during the tachycardia (P < 0.001). In 10 of 12 patients with atypical AVNRT, the AH interval during atrial pacing was more than 40 msec longer than the AH interval measured during the tachycardia. In contrast, in patients with ORT or atrial tachycardia, the differences in AH interval between atrial pacing and tachycardia were never more than 20 and 10 msec, respectively. Conclusion: The difference in the AH interval between atrial pacing and the tachycardia allows a simple and rapid means of differentiating atypical AVNRT from other types of long RP tachycardias.

> The three possible mechanisms of long RP tachyciirdia consist of atypical (fast-slow) AV nodaJ reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), orthodromic reciprocating lachyciu"dia utilizing a relatively slowly conducting accessory pathway in the retrograde direction, and atriai tachycardia.  


  
> However, at times the difterentiation of atypical AVNRTr from orthodromic tachycardia utilizing a slowly conducting accessory pathway or an atrial tachycardia may be challenging, particularly when the differential diagnosis includes a posteroseptal accessory pathway or an atrial tachycardia arising in the posleroseptal right atrium.'

*A coinpari.soii of the AAH in patients with alypicat AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT}. orthodrontic tachycardia (ORT), and atrial tachycardia. Ttte AAH represents the difference between the AH interval during atrial pacing in the setting of sinus rhythm at the tachycardia cycle tengrh and the AH Interval during the tachycardia. Att AH intervats were measured from ihe Hi.s-hundte etecirogram. Ttte vertical bars represent the mean ± 1 SD. AH = atrial-His inten'at: NS = not significant.*

  
> This finding is in concert with the results of prior studies, which have provided other lines of evidence that an upper common pathway does not exist in the reentrant circuit of AVNRT.  


  
> In every patient with atypical AVNRT in whom there was a AAH > 40 msec, atrial pacing at the tachycardia cycle length in the setting of sinus rhythm never resulted in the induction of tachycardia  


  
> The strong association between the absence of a AAH and the induction of atypical AVNRT suggests that the AAH in patients with atypical AVNRT is attributable to anterograde conduction over the fast pathway during tachycardia and over the slow pathway during atrial pacing  


  
> In contrast, if atrial pacing induces atypical AVNRT, anterograde conduction during pacing would, by necessity, have had to occur over the fast pathway, explaining the similarity in AH intervals during pacing and tachycardia.

*An example of a patient with atypical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) with a cycle length of 410 msec in wtiom there was a AAH of 0 and the induction of atypical AVNRT by atrial p<wing at a cycle length of 410 msec. The AH intervals during atypical A VNRT and high right atrial pacing were 150 msec. Tlie last three .stimuli (S) of an atrial pacing train at a cycle length of 410 msec are shown, and the tachycardia was induced (asterisk) by the ne.xt to la.st pacing stimulus*

*A schematic illustration of how the atrial recording site might account for a different AH inten^at during tachycardia and pacing. In the left panel is .shown a schematic model of atypical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) utilizing the compact atrioventricular node (AVN) and its anterior and posterior input.\. This model is based on the results of high-resolution intraoperative mapping studies in patients with atypical (fa.Kt'stow) AVNRT.'- If the atrial recording .site (A) is not located at the point of enity of the tachycardia wavefront (dashed arrows) into the A VN. there may be simultaneous conduction of the tachycardia wavefront to "A" (solid arrow) and into the AVN. In contrast, the right panel demonstrates that during high right atrial pacing, there would be sequential activation of "A. " then the A VN. Therefore, the AH inter\-al during pacing would be longer than during tachycardia. CS os = coronary sinus ostium; TA - tricuspid annulus.*

Of the long RP tachycardias...

1. Atypical AVNRT
1. Atrial tachycardia (posteroseptal)
1. Orthodromic reentrant tachcyardia (retrograde AP)

... the $\Delta AH>40$ ms is suggestive of atypical AVNRT over other tachycardias. 
The $\Delta AH$ is calculated as the *AH* interval during sinus pacing and the *AH* interval during tachycardia. 
In both AT and AVRT the AH should be relatively fixed in the anterograde direction if they are using tissue close to the Triangle of Koch. 

For atypical AVNRT however  the fast pathway is activated anterograde, and the slow pathway retrograde, during the tachycardia.
But, during sinus rhythm, the slow pathway is activated in the anterograde direction, leading to increased *AH* time.
