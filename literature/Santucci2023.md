## Abstract
Background
Atypical atrial flutters often involve complex circuits. Classic methods of identifying ablation targets, including detailed electroanatomical mapping and entrainment within a well-defined isthmus, may not always be sufficient to allow the critical isthmus to be delineated and ablated, with flutter termination and prevention of reinduction.
Objectives
This study sought a systematic method to classify conduction barriers and isthmuses as critical or noncritical that would improve understanding and ablation success. We also sought a construct unifying single- and dual-loop re-entry. Re-entrant circuits are bounded on 2 sides, although these are not consistently identified. We hypothesized 2 distinct critical boundaries, and a critical isthmus could be consistently defined without requiring entrainment, and ablation connecting these 2 boundaries would terminate tachycardia.
Methods
Activation maps were created electroanatomically. Conduction barriers were classified as noncritical barriers or critical boundaries. Critical boundaries showed sequential activation around the barrier, spanning ≥90% of the cycle length. Noncritical barriers showed nonsequential, parallel, or colliding activation or <90% of the cycle length. Only tissue separating the 2 critical boundaries defined a critical isthmus (CI); all others were considered noncritical. The effect of ablation across a CI was assessed.
Results
Complete maps were obtained in 128 cases in 121 patients (28 atypical right atrial, 100 left atrial). In all cases, 2 distinct critical boundaries were identified. Ablation across a CI connecting these critical boundaries terminated tachycardia in 123 of 128 cases (96.1%). Failures were due to inability to achieve block across the isthmus.
Conclusions
Activation mapping of atypical atrial flutter allows consistent identification of 2 critical boundaries. Successful ablation connecting the 2 critical boundaries reliably results in termination of atypical atrial flutter.

*Above, Dark arrowheads indicate activation direction. Yellow and blue arrows show sequential activation around each critical boundary (CB). (A) Representation of single-loop re-entry, such as in typical atrial flutter, with an anterior (1) and a posterior (2) boundary. (B) The 2 boundaries in an ambiguous position between classic single- and dual-loop re-entry. (C) Two boundaries close together with a narrow isthmus, typically represented as dual-loop re-entry. Below, (D) Re-entry illustration with the 2 CBs separated by a critical isthmus (CI), as well as a noncritical barrier (NCB) and noncritical isthmuses (NCI) between a CB and an NCB. (E) Alternative ablation option to connect the 2 CBs indirectly by using an NCB. In such cases, tachycardias did not terminate with ablation across a single NCB. (F) Map of mitral annular flutter (1), with the right pulmonary veins (PVs) (2) as the posterior boundary. Ablation can be directly from mitral annulus/scar (gray) to right PVs (red circles) or via the use of indirect connection using the NCB (left PVs) requiring both a roof and a mitral isthmus line (yellow rings).*

*A) Boundary 1 is identified as the mitral annulus with sequential activation around this boundary. (B) Caudocranial activation is seen on the septum and posterior wall (orange arrows), consistent with parallel activation around the right pulmonary veins, which identifies these as noncritical barrier. This finding also helps identify the left pulmonary veins as boundary 2. Mitral isthmus ablation eliminated tachycardia. MRAT 1⁄4 macro re-entrant atrial tachycardia.*

*(A) Counterclockwise activation around a posterior wall critical barrier (1). (B, C) Parallel activation around the right pulmonary veins and mitral annulus, respectively, identifying those as noncritical barriers (NCBs). (D) The second boundary (2) was the left superior pulmonary vein and a line of block on the ridge side of the left pulmonary veins, with clockwise activation around this. Ablation of conduction channels between boundaries 1 and 2 (red tags) terminated tachycardia, and the left pulmonary veins were re-isolated.*

*(A) This flutter is bounded by the left inferior pulmonary vein (1) and a small area of scar in the mitral isthmus (2). (B) Parallel caudocranial activation aroud both sides of the mitral annulus identifies this as a noncritical (passive) boundary. A single lesion delivered to the critical isthmus between boundaries 1 and 2 terminated tachycardia. MRAT 1⁄4 macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia.*

*In this mitral annular flutter, clockwise activation is identified around the mitral annulus (1) The left pulmonary veins were not a critical boundary; therefore, ablation of the mitral isthmus might alter but would not be predicted to terminate the flutter. The second boundary was identified on the anterior wall/roof (2), and flutter terminated with ablation of the narrow channel between these 2 boundaries.*

  
> As mentioned, when the 2 CBs are close together on the same side of the surface with a narrow central isthmus, the tachycardia is described as dual-loop reentry.  


  
> With this understanding, the description of macrore-entry around a single boundary is no longer sufficient to fully understand the circuit.  


  
> Successful ablation requires fully blocking the wavefront by creating block across any isthmus between the 2 CBs.  


  
> However, although frequently a narrow, slowly conducting isthmus is the preferred target for ablation, there is no a priori requirement that a CI be narrow or slowly conducting.  


  
> Entrainment criteria can confirm macrore-entry when uncertainty exists and can determine whether a particular location is within the active circuit. However, it does not distinguish CIs from NCIs, and a long postpacing interval does not fully exclude a CI.

*(A) Clockwise activation around the mitral annulus (boundary 1) in a heavily scarred left atrium. (B) Boundary 2 is more complex. The posterior wall showed wavefront collision (dotted orange line) from above and below (orange arrows). This creates a functionally large complex combined posterior boundary (boundary 2, area outlined by blue dashed line) comprising all 4 pulmonary veins and the posterior wall, with counterclockwise activation around this boundary. Ablation of a small isthmus between these boundaries on the anterior roof (middle red tagsmall yellow arrow in A) terminated tachycardia with the first lesion.*
