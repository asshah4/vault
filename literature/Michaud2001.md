## Abstract
OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine whether the response to ventricular pacing during tachycardia is useful for differentiating atypical atrioventricular node re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) from orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT) using a septal accessory pathway. BACKGROUND Although it is usually possible to differentiate atypical AVNRT from ORT using a septal accessory pathway, a definitive diagnosis is occasionally elusive. METHODS In 30 patients with atypical AVNRT and 44 patients with ORT using a septal accessory pathway, the right ventricle was paced at a cycle length 10 to 40 ms shorter than the tachycardia cycle length (TCL). The ventriculo-atrial (VA) interval and TCL were measured just before pacing. The interval between the last pacing stimulus and the last entrained atrial depolarization (stimulus-atrial [S-A] interval) and the post-pacing interval (PPI) at the right ventricular apex were measured on cessation of ventricular pacing. RESULTS All 30 patients with atypical AVNRT and none of the 44 patients with ORT using a septal accessory pathway had an S-A–VA interval >85 ms and PPI–TCL >115 ms. CONCLUSIONS The S-A–VA interval and PPI–TCL are useful in distinguishing atypical AVNRT from ORT using a septal accessory pathway.

*Entrainment of atrioventricular node re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) from the right ventricular septum (RVS) at a cycle length of 510 ms. (A) The ventriculo-atrial (VA) interval and tachycardia cycle length (TCL) are measured immediately before entrainment. (B) The stimulus-atrial (S-A) interval is measured from the last pacing stimulus to the last entrained high right atrial (HRA) electrogram, and the post-pacing interval (PPI) is measured from the last pacing stimulus to the return cycle RV electrogram. The S-A–VA interval is 120 ms, and the PPI–TCL is 150 ms. HBd 5 His bundle distal; S 5 stimulus.*

  
> The diagnosis of atypical AVNRT was made when the VA interval in the high right atrium was $100 ms, the earliest retrograde atrial activation was in the atrial septum and one or more of the following criteria were satisfied: 1) AV block during tachycardia (3); 2) AV dissociation with rapid ventricular pacing at a cycle length between 200 and 250 ms during tachycardia (4); 3) a delta atrial-His bundle (AH) interval .40 ms (5); and 4) a delta His-atrial (HA) interval .210 ms (6)  


  
> The diagnosis of ORT was made when the earliest retrograde activation was in the atrial septum in the absence of the aforementioned criteria, and one or more of the following criteria were satisfied: 1) the tachycardia was reset or terminated by a premature ventricular depolarization that occurred when the His bundle was refractory (3); and 2) the VA interval during tachycardia increased by $10 ms, with the development of functional bundle branch block (7).

*Entrainment of orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT) using a right posteroseptal bypass tract from the right ventricular apex (RVA) at a cycle length of 440 ms. (A) The ventriculo-atrial (VA) interval and tachycardia cycle length (TCL) are measured immediately before entrainment. (B) The stimulus-atrial (S-A) interval is measured from the last pacing stimulus to the last entrained high right atrial (HRA) electrogram, and the post-pacing interval (PPI) is measured from the last pacing stimulus to the return cycle RV electrogram. The S-A–VA interval is 40 ms, and the PPI–TCL is 80 ms. HBD 5 His bundle distal; S 5 stimulus.*

*Scatterplot showing the mean value 6 SD of the stimulus-atrialventriculo-atrial (S-A–VA) interval (ms) for patients with either orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT) using a septal accessory pathway or atypical atrioventricular node re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT). The line drawn at 85 ms represents the discriminant point distinguishing the two forms of long VA tachycardia.*

The line drawn at 115 ms represents the discriminant point distinguishing the two forms of long VA tachycardia.*
