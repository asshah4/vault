## Abstract
Introduction: Defining whether retrograde ventriculoatrial (V-A) conduction is via the AV node (AVN) or an accessory pathway (AP) is important during ablation procedures for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). With the introduction of ventricular extrastimuli (VEST), retrograde right bundle branch block (RBBB) may occur, prolonging the V-H interval, but only when AV node conduction is present. We hypothesized that when AP conduction was present, the V-A interval would increase less than the V-H interval, whereas with retrograde nodal conduction, the V-A interval would increase at least as much as the V-H interval. Methods and Results: We retrospectively reviewed the electrophysiological studies of patients undergoing ablation for AVN reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) (55) or AVRT (50), for induction of retrograde RBBB during the introduction of VEST, and the change in the measured V-H and V-A intervals. Results were found to be reproducible between independent observers. Out of 105 patients, 84 had evidence of induced retrograde RBBB. The average V-H interval increase with induction of RBBB was 53.7 ms for patients with AVRT and 54.4 ms for patients with AVNRT (P = NS). The average V-A interval increase with induction of RBBB was 13.6 ms with AVRT and 70.1 ms with AVNRT (P < 0.001). All patients with a greater V-H than V-A interval change had AVRT, and those with a smaller had AVNRT. Conclusions: Induction of retrograde RBBB during VEST is common during an electrophysiological study for SVT. The relative change in the intervals during induction of RBBB accurately differentiates between retrograde AVN and AP conduction.

> Despite the availability of these techniques, distinction between retrograde AVN and AP conduction can be difficult to make, particularly when arrhythmia is not inducible.  


  
> This maneuver has limitations, particularly with left lateral APs and when proximal retrograde right bundle branch  block (RBBB) is present.  


  
> decremental ventricular pacing and differential site ventricular pacing have limitations in patients with decrementally conducting accessory pathways or  pathways near the AV conduction system  


  
> While an increase in the V-H interval necessarily occurs with retrograde RBBB, whether a similar increase occurs in the V-A interval depends on the nature of V-A conduction.  


  
> An increase in the retrograde V-H interval by 50 ms or more with a decrease in the extrastimulus coupling interval for the paced extrastimulus of less than or equal to 20 ms was considered to be due to a retrograde RBBB  


  
> An AP was diagnosed when the increase in the V-A interval was less than the increase in the V-H interval when RBBB was induced. Conduction via the AVN was diagnosed if the increase in the V-A interval was equal to or greater than the increase in the V-H interval following induction of retrograde RBBB without a change in the retrograde activation sequence.

*Depicted is the relative change in V-H versus V-A intervals in patients with induced retrograde RBBB with diagnoses of either AVNRT or AVRT. The range of the V1-V2 interval required to achieve retrograde RBBB was 210–310 ms at a drive train of 400 ms and 210–410 ms at a drive train of 600 ms in patients with AVRT and 180–300 ms at drive train of 400 ms and 230–460 ms at a drive train of 600 ms in patients with AVNRT.*

  
> It was also observed that a change in the V-A interval of less than 50 ms when retrograde RBBB was induced accurately excluded AVN conduction in 100% and was diagnostic of retrograde AP conduction in 95% of patients (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 95%) (Fig. 3A,B).
