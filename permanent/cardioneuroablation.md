The basic physiology behind cardioneurablation involves the ganglionated plexi and how the interact with cardiac tissue, particularly atrial tissue.

@Pachon2023 reviews the current status of cardioneuroablation in 2023, but with a focus on its role in bradycardia and vasovagal syncope. See [Pachon2023](../literature/Pachon2023.md) for article annotations and figures.
