- Arrhythmia thresholds affected by sympathetic and vagal activity 
	- Intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis is critical for arrhythmogenesis during mental stress
	- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Sympathetic nervous activity is slower onset, but vagolysis is rapid, thus being a more likely causal component of arrhythmogenesis
	- Sympathetic/adreneric neurons release catecholamines (NE) that directly affect the myocardium
	- NPY and galanin is also released, which both inhibit cholinergic activity [@Herring2012; @Herring2015a]
	- Both inhibit firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium [@Kalla2020; @Herring2008] 
		- Galanin released as a adrenergic co-transmitter, binding to GalR1 receptors
		- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor
		- Both directly/indirectly involve protein kinase C
	- NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2) [@Coote2013]
