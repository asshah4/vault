# Approach

There is an import feature from Zotero while in Obsidian that will let us pull in a citation, using the citation key (@AuthorYYYY) that should be the title.

## Highlighter

- <font color='gold'>Yellow</font> is for standard highlighting of interesting comments
- <font color='orange'>Orange</font> is controversial or disagreeing comment
- <font color='violetred'>Magenta/Pink</font> is for methods of note
- <font color='teal'>Green</font> is an important reference for follow-up
- <font color='royalblue'>Blue</font> is about a major conclusion or finding
