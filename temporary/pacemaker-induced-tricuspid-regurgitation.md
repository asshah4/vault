# Lead Extractions

When pulling out RV leads, there seems to be an increase in the risk of tricuspid regurgitation due to damage of the tricuspid leaflets.

# Lead Implantation

During implantation how hte lead lies across the valve may affect how TR is formed. 

Imaging approaches may include 3D visualization of the valve with implantation.
