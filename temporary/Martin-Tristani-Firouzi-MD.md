> Dr. Tristani-Firouzi is a Professor of Pediatrics and the H.A. and Edna Benning Presidential Chair. His research is dedicated to the study of Precision Cardiovascular Medicine. With extramural funding, he has built an infrastructure supporting personalized medicine by connecting disciplines that excel in genomic analysis, functional analyses, and health care information technology, while leveraging the unique local resources such as the University of Utah Electronic Data Warehouse (EDW) and its linkage to the Utah Population Database (UPDB), the largest genealogical database in the world linked to medical records. He serves as Principal Investigator for several prestigious consortia and leads multiple projects broadly related to genomic medicine. His lab utilizes zebrafish and human induced pluripotent stem cells as transgenic model systems for the study of inherited arrhythmia disorders. He is highly committed to mentoring and overseeing the training of the next generation of cardiovascular clinician scientists. Dr. Tristani-Firouzi previously served as the Associate Director of the CVRTI and now is a member of the Senior Advisory Committee. In addition, Dr. Tristani-Firouzi is the Co-Director of the Center for Genomic Medicine, the University of Utahâ€™s premiere center for genomic innovation, discovery, and the translation of genomic medicine into improved clinical care.
